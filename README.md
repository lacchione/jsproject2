# Project 2
# WEB 501 - JavaScript 4
# Phil Aylesworth

I started the project by creating my repo called jsproject2. It was created 
with a README, as well as using a node based .gitignore and finally under the MIT License. 

Upon creation, I first created a dev branch off of my master. Shortly after creating this branch I made my first commit to this branch in which was my gulpfile, alongside all the files that a user needs in order to download my node_modules on there PC. 

After this I checked in my .gitignore that node_modules folder was there, and then added to the .gitignore file in order to ignore my production folder. 

Once his was taken care of, my next commit was adding all of my source files to my project. This included my markdown pages (4 of them) alongside my template pages, and the pictures that would be going onto my site. 

After all these files where added my base site was completed, in which, it was time to make the first merge from dev to master. From here I moved onto my first Feature. 

# Introduction of Feature 1: SCSS addition to entire site

The first step I took when starting this feature was making a branch off of dev called "cssfeature". Once created I began working inside this new branch by creating a new file called styles.scss. 

This page contained all the styles in order to style my 4 pages to my liking. 

After all the tweaking was done on my styles it was time to commit them, and then merge them back into dev in order to fully complete my Feature 1. 

With this merge to dev, it was time to move onto my Feature 2, incorporating Typescript/JavaScript.


# Introduction of Feature 2: TypeScript/JavaScript Lightboxes & Caption

To start of this feature I did a similar thing that I did in feature 1 in that created a brand new branch off of dev called jsfeature. This would house all the work I did on my javascript in order to incorporate a lightbox. 

With this, I created a main.ts file in which housed all my typescript. From here my gulpfile transformed it into javascript which then caused all my pictures on my site to act on a user click. 

On the user click it now displayed the picture in a lightbox with a caption, and then disappeared back to normal on the second user click.

With this, I completed feature 2 and was ready to merge back into dev.

# Final Site Wrap Up

With Feature 1, and Feature 2 merged back into dev I made a merge back to master to wrap up the entire project. 

Shortly after that merge I noticed some changes that I missed over in my first checks on feature 2. With that, I tweaked some things on Feature 2, then merged it back into dev, and then merged it all back into master again to have a completed project in my Master branch.


Thanks,
Luca.
