Scoring is a match system where ten axes are thrown per match. The player with the highest points of their ten thrown axes wins the match. In case of a tie a "Sudden Death" throw is made for the highest score. Sudden death throws are done until one thrower scores higher than the other. Scoring is determined by where you strike your axe into the target. The WATL targets have a red bullseye ring, followed by four empty rings, and then a blue ring. The scoring is 6, 4, 3, 2, and 1 point respectively. Additionally, there are blue dots in the 1 point ring, known as "Kill-shot," and can only be used for the 5th throw and the final throw in the match for 8 points. Point designation is based on the highest point value the axe touches when it lands and sticks.
